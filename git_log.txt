    JobId and JobName stored in Job Class. New class called JobInfo created to store JobDescription. Converted addToMyRequested() and addUserToJobRequestor() functions into one method because they are called back to back.

    JobId and JobName moved to Job class. JobDescription and other related information stored in  a new class JobInfo. Required methods created. Converted addJobtoMyRequested function and addUsertoJobRequestor()  to a single function, since they are called back to back and should be done in one method itself.
